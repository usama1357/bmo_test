1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?  
   Took me around 10-12 hours in total

a. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
I would definately work on User Interface and make it more pretty, Also would work on Landing page
with recommended books etc.

b. If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I think it was a good evaluation, it covered most of the concepts of front end development.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
   Performance issue is usually when API takes long to respond. I would continue tasks of API on background and keep going with my program.

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?
   I would definately add the covers links in the search query, rather than making it two step for getting covers, I would like to add it in one query

5. Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
